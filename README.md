# Integrated model of Puma in the Grand Tetons

This is the code and data necessary to fit integrated (survival/abundance) models to puma populations in the Grand Tetons. Data include Puma survival and abundances as well as elk and wolf abundances (used as covariates) from 2001 to 2016. In addition we have sampling effort data that can be used to correct Puma counts. We are interested in how the covariates might be driving the observed decline of Puma. 

We fit a range of models that included covariates in Puma survival and fecundity in order to test which covariates can explain the decline.
